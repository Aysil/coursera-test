			Sushi is a type of food preparation originating in Japan, consisting of cooked vinegared rice combined with other
			ingredients such as raw seafood, vegetables and sometimes tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation
			vary widely, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is rice. Although commonly mistaken for sushi, sashimi,
			which is also a Japanese delicacy, consists of thinly sliced raw fish and may or may not be served with rice.
			Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties
			of sushi use cooked ingredients and many are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.
			Popular garnishes are often made using daikon. The original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi was first made in
			Southeast Asia. Fish was salted and wrapped in fermented rice, a traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Narezushi was made
			of this gutted fish which was stored in fermented rice for months at a time for preservation. The fermentation of the rice
			prevented the fish from spoiling. The fermented rice was discarded and fish was the only part consumed. This early type
			of sushi became an important source of protein for the Japanese. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form
			no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting", a reflection of its historic origin as a fermented
			food. The oldest form of sushi in Japan, narezushi, is still made by wrapping fish in soured fermenting rice, which causes
			the fish proteins to break down into their constituent amino acids. The fermenting rice and fish have both a sour and an
			umami taste. Contemporary Japanese sushi has little resemblance to the traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Originally,
			when the fermented fish was taken out of the rice, only the fish was consumed while the fermented rice was discarded. The
			strong-tasting and smelling funazushi, a kind of narezushi made near Lake Biwa in Japan, resembles the traditional
			fermented dish. Beginning in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) of Japan, vinegar was added to the mixture for better taste
			and preservation. The vinegar accentuated the rice's sourness and was known to increase its shelf life, allowing the
			fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. In the following centuries, sushi in Osaka evolved into
			oshi-zushi. The seafood and rice were pressed using wooden (usually bamboo) molds. By the mid 18th century, this form of
			sushi had reached Edo (contemporary Tokyo). The contemporary version, internationally known as "sushi", was created by
			Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that
			was not fermented (therefore prepared quickly) and could be conveniently eaten with one's hands. The size of the previous
			sushi was about three times as large as contemporary ones. Originally, this sushi was known as Edomae zushi because it used
			freshly caught fish in the Edo-mae (Edo Bay or Tokyo Bay). Though the fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes
			from Tokyo Bay, it is still formally known as Edomae nigirizushi. The Oxford English Dictionary notes the earliest written
			mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with
			fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring". However, there is also mention of sushi in a Japanese-English dictionary
			from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries. Inarizushi is a pouch of fried tofu
			typically filled with sushi rice alone. It is named after the Shinto god Inari, who is believed to have a fondness for
			fried tofu. The pouch is normally fashioned as deep-fried tofu. Regional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette.
			It should not be confused with inari maki, which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu.A version of inarizushi that
			includes green beans, carrots, and gobo along with rice, wrapped in a triangular aburage (fried tofu) piece, is a Hawaiian
			specialty, where it is called cone sushi and is often sold in okazu-ya (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.
			Makizushi, norimaki or makimono is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat known as a makisu. Makizushi
			is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso
			(perilla) leaves. Makizushi is usually cut into six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some
			common types of makizushi, but many other kinds exist.Futomaki is a large cylindrical piece, usually with nori on the
			outside. A typical futomaki is five to six centimeters (2–2.5 in) in diameter. They are often made with two, three, or
			more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. During the evening of the Setsubun festival, it is
			traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form, where it is called ehō-maki. By 2000 the
			custom had spread to all of Japan. Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may utilize strips of cucumber, kampyō gourd, 
			takenoko bamboo shoots, or lotus root. Strips of tamagoyaki omelette, tiny fish roe, chopped tuna, and oboro whitefish
			flakes are typical non-vegetarian fillings. Hosomaki is a small cylindrical piece, with nori on the outside. A typical
			hosomaki has a diameter of about two and a half centimeters (1 in). They generally contain only one filling, often tuna,
			cucumber, kanpyō, thinly sliced carrots, or, more recently, avocado. Kappamaki, a kind of Hosomaki filled with cucumber,
			is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa. Traditionally, kappamaki is consumed
			to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food, so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the
			tastes of other foods. Tekkamaki is a kind of hosomaki filled with raw tuna. Although it is believed that the word tekka,
			meaning "red hot iron", alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh, it actually originated as a quick snack to
			eat in gambling dens called tekkaba, much like the sandwich. Negitoromaki is a kind of hosomaki filled with scallion (negi)
			and chopped tuna (toro). Fatty tuna is often used in this style. Tsunamayomaki is a kind of hosomaki filled with canned
			tuna tossed with mayonnaise. Ehomaki is a roll composed of seven ingredients considered to be lucky. Ehomaki are often
			eaten on setsubun in Japan. The typical ingredients include kanpyo, egg, eel, and shiitake mushrooms. Ehōmaki often include
			other ingredients too. People usually eat the ehōmaki while facing the direction considered to be auspicious that year. 
			Temaki is a large cone-shaped piece of nori on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical temaki
			is about ten centimeters (4 in) long, and is eaten with fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks.
			For optimal taste and texture, temaki must be eaten quickly after being made because the nori cone soon absorbs moisture
			from the filling and loses its crispness, making it somewhat difficult to bite through. For this reason, the nori in
			pre-made or take-out temaki is sealed in plastic film which is removed immediately before eating.
